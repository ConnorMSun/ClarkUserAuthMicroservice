Hi Clark! This is my implementation of your user authentication service. It's pretty standard so there shouldn't be anything unexpected you have to get used to.

Existing API endpoint: '/login'

Here are the steps to get it working:
1. Run the following commands:
npm init -y
npm install express

2. Run the microservice:
EITHER DO
a) node server.js
--This runs the microservice itself and allows it to be interacted with--

b) node test.js
--This runs some tests for the microservice, showing the expected and actual output--
